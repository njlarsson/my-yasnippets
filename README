Since there were no standard Java snippets in the yasnippet package, I
grew some of my own. Some of these are based on things I found on the
internet on the day I started with yasnippet, but I'm afraid I can't
remember which or where. They hardly have enough originality for
copyright protection, however. The same goes for mine. Just copy and
use in whatever way you need.
